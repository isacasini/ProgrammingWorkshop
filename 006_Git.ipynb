    "Git is a **version control system** — a tool that helps keep track of changes in files over time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When people hear *Git*, they often think of **GitHub**. But Git is not the same as GitHub — it’s the underlying tool. You can also use Git with other platforms like **GitLab** and **Bitbucket**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If you’ve ever ended up with files like this:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- super_crazy_code.py\n",
    "- super_crazy_code1.py\n",
    "- super_crazy_codev3.py\n",
    "- super_crazy_codeV4_FINAL.py\n",
    "- super_crazy_codeFINAL_FINAL.py\n",
    "\n",
    "…then Git is something you might want to look into! Instead of saving endless versions of files, Git helps you track changes, roll back if needed, and collaborate with others more easily.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this workshop, we won’t go too deep into Git as a full version control system. If you’re interested in that, the official Git tutorial is a great place to start:  \n",

    "- **Understanding the structure of a repo**  \n",
    "- **Running someone else’s code**  \n",

    "## Installing Git\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can start using Git, we need to make sure it’s installed on your computer.  \n",
    "Follow the instructions below depending on your operating system:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Windows\n",
    "1. Go to the [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) download page.  \n",
    "2. Download the installer and run it.  \n",
    "3. During installation, you can accept the default options (these are fine for most users).  \n",
    "4. Once complete, open **Git Bash** (installed with Git) to check everything works.\n",
    "\n",
    "### macOS\n",
    "1. The easiest way is to use **Homebrew**. If you don’t have it, install it from [brew.sh](https://brew.sh/).  \n",
    "2. In a terminal, run:  \n",
    "```bash\n",
    "   brew install git\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, you can download the installer from the Git website\n",
    "\n",
    "## Verify the installation\n",
    "\n",
    "To check that Git is installed correctly, open the Git Bash application that was installed on your machine and run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "   git --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You should see the installed version number. e.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "   git version 2.47.1.windows.2\n",
    "```\n",

    "## What Git Can Do\n",
    "\n",
    "The main purpose of Git is **version control** — keeping track of changes in your files over time.  \n",
    "But in this workshop, we’re not going to focus on that. Instead, we’ll see how Git can be used to quickly **pull code from open repositories** and run it locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’d like to dive deeper into Git (things like logging into your GitHub account, collaborating on projects, or using version control for your own work), I recommend following a full Git tutorial: [Official Git Tutorial](https://git-scm.com/docs/gittutorial).  \n",
    "It’s especially worth it if you plan to work on larger projects — your future self will thank you!  \n",
    "\n",
    "For today, though, we’ll keep it simple.  \n",
    "The Git command we’ll use most is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git clone"

    "## Example 0: Cloning the Programming Workshop Repo\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we’re going to do is **clone the repository that contains this notebook**!  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Navigate to the Programming Workshop GitHub repo.  \n",
    "   If you get lost, here’s the link: [Programming Workshop Repo](https://github.com/isacasini/ProgrammingWorkshop)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Find the HTTPS URL for the repository:  \n",

    "   - Copy the URL shown under “HTTPS.”\n",
    "\n",
    "   ![Programming Workshop Repository Screenshot](images/program-workshop.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Open **Git Bash** (or your terminal) and navigate to the folder where you want to save this repo.  \n",
    "   Personally, I like to keep all repositories in a single folder called `git-code`, but you can choose any location you like.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Clone the repository using the URL you just copied:\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   git clone [paste-the-URL-here]\n",
    "\n",
    "![gitbashscreeny](images/git-bash-clone.png)\n",

    "`conda install pandas numpy matplotlib`\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- **README.md** - This file is displayed on the repository’s webpage. It should contain an overview of what the repository is and include steps on how to run the code.\n",
    "- **requirements.txt** - This file lists the dependencies needed to run the code in the repository.\n",
    "- **faker_data_analysis.ipynb** - This is a notebook file which contains the code that we are trying to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the description of the README.md file you can see that this repository wants you to create a new enviroment using a different command: \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python -m venv env\n",
    "source env/bin/activate   # On macOS/Linux\n",
    "env\\Scripts\\activate      # On Windows\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This repository is set up using a **venv** virtual environment. In the past, we have used **conda** to create virtual environments. It doesn’t really matter which method you choose—**venv** or **conda**—but a good rule of thumb is to follow the instructions provided by the repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this repository uses **venv**, we’ll do the same. When you run the command, you’ll notice a folder called **env** will appear. This folder contains the Python environment. You can explore the files inside, but it’s not necessary to understand everything about them just yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you’re in this environment, you can run the next command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As we know, `pip install` is used to install packages from the PyPI index. The `-r` flag indicates that we are passing in a requirements file, and `requirements.txt` is the requirements file that we found in the repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once that runs our enviroment is ready to go! You can open the jupyter notebook in vscode, start you're virtual enviroment and run the code!\n"
