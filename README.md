This repository will store tutorials for the Programming Workshops hosted at AIBN open to the Biosustainability Hub.

These tutorials target a beginner level programming audience, but do not aim to provide a full entry course but rather to cover typical tasks required for handling data/experiments in the field of biotechnology.
